SPOCK
------
### A Human Computer Interaction Engine (unix flavoured)
Mankind's interaction with Machines began with hitting a poor little array of plastic keys and moved on to clicking buttons of a helpless wired rodent. Then, over the years (and thanks to Android and Microsoft!!) we can touch our PCs. But things do not stop there. Nature is sense-based. With Spock, we bring the next level of interaction with your computational units with the help of speech and natural gestures.
